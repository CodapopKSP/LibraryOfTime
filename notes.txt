Confidence Levels
Note: Confidence levels are only applicable in the rated time of each calendar.
    This could be only positive years since the epoch or a range of years where the calculation directly applies.
    This is especially the case if a calendar has gone through revisions throughout history.
Note: These confidence levels refer to how these algorithms are applied on this site.
    It is unrelated to how confident historians are in the facts presented here.
    Disagreements among historians are often noted in the Accuracy tab, but that is not the aim of this site.

Exact:
- Explicitly tied to the Gregorian Calendar or Unix time
- Defined by a well-understood algorithm with an exact epoch

High:
- Relies on another calculation with a High confidence level
- Relies on an approximation in such a way that errors can build over a long period of time
- Relies on an approximation of sunrise or sunset to mark the beginning of a day

Medium:
- Relies on another calculation with a Medium confidence level
- Has known errors with an unknown cause but is otherwise correct
- Relies on an algorithm that could have been misinterpreted

Low:
- Relies on another calculation with a Low confidence level
- Relies on a poorly-understood algorithm
- Has an undefined epoch or anchor date
