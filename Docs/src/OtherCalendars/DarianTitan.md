#### Overview

The Darian calendar for Titan, moon of Saturn, was created by Thomas Gangale and is a continuation of the calendars created for Mars and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It is intended to closely align with the Martian Darian calendar, roughly sharing an epoch as well as all 24 months.

As the solar day of Titan is nearly 16 Earth days long, its day is broken into 16 units of time called 'circads' that are ~24 hours each and act as calendar days.

This calendar features 24 months of 28 or 32 circads each, allowing for a clean division of the 8-circad week.

Leap years add an entire week, split evenly between the 12th and 24th months, adding 4 circads each for a total of 32 circads, allowing it to stay in sync with the Martian Darian calendar.

Years don't always begin and end at midnight on Titan's prime meridian, as the circad system takes precedence over the solar day.

#### Accuracy

The accuracy of this calendar system is wholely dependent on the writings and calculations of Thomas Gangale. It is likely that these calculations weren't precise enough to extend more than a few decades, as they do seem to drift from ephemeris data.

The epoch is noted to account for the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter in the Galilean calendars, but it isn't clear if it has also been accounted for in this calendar.
