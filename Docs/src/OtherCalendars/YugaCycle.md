#### Overview

The Yuga Cycle is the cyclic age in Hindu cosmology. It is divided into 4 yugas, each divided into dawn, proper, and dusk periods, that lasts for a total of 4,320,000 years.

Each yuga in the cycle lasts for a shorter amount of time but, according to Hindu cosmology, also reduces the moral and phsical state of the world before a cataclysm and re-establishment of the dharma and restarting of the cycle.

The current yuga, Kali Yuga, is the shortest and worst. It will last until the year 428,899 CE.
