#### Overview

The Pawukon calendar of Bali, Indonesia is a 210-day cycle of ten repeating and undulating "weeks" that happen concurrently. The first week has only 1 day, the second week has 2 days, the third week has 3 days, and so on.

Weeks 3, 5, 6, and 7 all simply cycle through their days. Weeks 4 and 8 also cycle but repeat the 71st day for days 72 and 73, a form of intercalation, in order to match the 210-day cycle. Week 9 also intercalates by repeating the 1st day for days 2, 3, and 4.

Weeks 1, 2, and 10 operate on more complex rules, involving adding the 'urip', a special number assigned to each day, of the days of Week 5 and Week 7 and adding 1. If the resulting number is even, then Week 1 and 2 are the first and second days respectively. If it's odd, then Week 2 is the first day and Week 1 is missing entirely. If this number matches the urip of any day in Week 10, then it is that day in Week 10.

Each of the 30 cycles of Week 7 also has a name. This calendar does not count the number of cycles and has no epoch.
