#### Overview

The SCA calendar is the calendar used by the Society for Creative Anachronism. It is based off the Gregorian calendar, sharing months and days, but with a different epoch.

Years are written as roman numerals and denoted with 'A.S.', short for 'Anno Societatis', meaning 'in the year of the Society', counting the number of years since the First Tournament on 1 May 1966 CE. Years begin on May 1st, so April 30th is the last day of the previous year.
