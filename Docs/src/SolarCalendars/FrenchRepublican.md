#### Overview

The French Republican calendar was used during and after the French Revolution from 1793 to 1805 and was a drastic change to the Gregorian calendar.

It featured twelve months of 30 days each, broken into 3 weeks of 10 days. The remaining 5 or 6 days of each solar year were the Sansculottides, to be treated as national holidays at the end of the year.

The new year started on the Autumn Equinox, and years were written in Roman numerals with the era name of 'l'ère républicaine', or 'Republican Era', abbreviated here as 'RE'.

#### Accuracy

This calendar depends on the accuracy of the equinox calculations, which are generally within a few minutes of accuracy and should only affect years where the equinox happens very close to midnight CET.

The French Republican calendar also had some issues with rules that contracticted each other, like a 4 year leap year rule conflicting with the date of the equinox. That rule has been ignored in favor of the equinox rule.
