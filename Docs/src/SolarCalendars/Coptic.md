#### Overview

The Coptic calendar, also known as the Alexandrian calendar, was used in Egypt until the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1875. It is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar but with leap days every four years, keeping it in sync with the Julian calendar while sharing months and days with the Ge'ez calendar.

It has 12 months of 30 days plus a smaller 13th month of 5 or 6 days. The new year starts on the 11th or 12th of September, and years are abbreviated with 'AM', meaning Anno Martyrum, or 'Year of the Martyrs'.

The Coptic calendar is still in use today by Egyptian farmers as well as the Coptic Orthodox Church.

#### Info

The Ge'ez calendar is precisely aligned with the Coptic calendar for its months and days. It's epoch, translated to 'Year of the Martyrs', is counted from the year Diocletian became Emperor of Rome, which was followed by a period of mass persecution of Christians.
