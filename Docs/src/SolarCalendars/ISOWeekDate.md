#### Overview

The ISO Week Date is part of the ISO standard for time. It breaks the year entirely into a whole number of weeks rather than months, which is often useful for business accounting.

Each year can have either 52 weeks (364 days) or 53 weeks (371 days). It keeps in sync with the Gregorian calendar.

#### Info

The ISO Week Date follows the format of Year-Week-Weekday, with Monday being the first day of the week and Sunday being the 7th day of the week.

#### Accuracy

Being an ISO standard with a standard calculation, this calendar is expected to be perfectly accurate.
