#### Overview

The Śaka Samvat, also known as the Indian National Calendar, is the calendar used for official government communications and media within India.

This calendar has 12 months of 30 or 31 days, with the second through fifth months having 31 days and the latter 6 having 30 to account for the yearly variation in Earth's orbital speed. Leap years follow the Gregorian calendar, lengthening the first month from 30 to 31 days.

Years are not denoted with anything, being shown as a simple number counting the number of years of the Shaka Era beginning on the day of the Northern Equinox in 78 CE.

As it follows the intercalation rules of the Gregorian calendar, its months start on the same day of the Gregorian calendar every year except for the month of Chaitra which starts one day earlier during leap years.
