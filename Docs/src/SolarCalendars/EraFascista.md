#### Overview

Era Fascista is a simple count of number of years since the start of the Fascist Era in Italy on October 29th, 1922, starting with Anno I.

Taking inspiration from the French Republican calendar, years were written in Roman numerals and it was intended to replace the Gregorian calendar.

#### Info

Era Fascista didn't really implement months, as it was used alongside the Gregorian calendar. Enscriptions marked in Era Fascista dates could use a number of different abbreviations, such as 'Anno', 'E.F.', 'Anno Fascista', 'A.F.', or simply 'A.'.

#### Accuracy

Era Fascista is intrinsically based on and locked to the Gregorian calendar, making it perfectly accurate.

#### Source

All of the information on this calendar came from its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_Fascista).
