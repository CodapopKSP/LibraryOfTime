#### Overview

The Haab is one of many calendars used by the Maya people. It features 18 months of 20 days plus a short month of 5 days, with days counted starting from 0. Thus, it has 365 days with no intercalation.

The Haab combines with another Maya calendar, the 260-day Tzolkin, to create the Maya Calendar Round. This is the cycle that the two calendars create, which takes roughly 52 years to complete.

Years do not increment outside the Calendar Round, so it is impossible to say for certain what the epoch for the Haab should be, but sometime around 550 BCE is accepted among historians.

#### Accuracy

This calendar is still used today in some Maya groups, and it has been calibrated using the calculator provided by the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. However, it also relies on the Long Count calendar being accurate.

#### Source

Much of the information on this calendar can be found at its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar).

The [Smithsonian website](https://maya.nmai.si.edu/calendar/maya-calendar-converter) has the current day as well as a converter, though it is broken for dates before the Long Count epoch.
