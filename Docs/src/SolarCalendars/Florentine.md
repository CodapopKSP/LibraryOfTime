#### Overview

The Florentine calendar was the calendar used in the Republic of Florence during the Middle Ages. It followed the Julian calendar for its years, months, and days with a few key differences: the new year started on March 25th.

This meant that January 1st of a given year was immediately after December 31st of the same year, and March 24th of that year was followed by March 25th of the next year.

Days also started at sunset (of the previous calendar day on the Julian calendar), which is approximated here as 6:00pm in Florence.

#### Accuracy

The Florentine calendar is intrinsically based on and locked to the Julian calendar, making it perfectly accurate. The only inaccuracies are the differences in the approximation of sunset to the actual time of sunset, which is expected to only differ by a few hours or minutes per day.
