#### Overview

The Minguo calendar, also known as the Republic of China calendar, is used in Taiwan and its territories. Following the traditional convention of numbering years after the current dynastic era, dates are counted in 民國 ('MinGuo'), translated as 'Year of the Republic' with year 1 being the establishment of the ROC in 1912, while its numerical months (月 "yue") and days (日 "ri") follow the Gregorian calendar.

The Minguo calendar was also used in China between 1912 and the fleeing of the ROC to Taiwan in 1949.

#### Info

Prior to the establishment of the Repiblic of China in 1912, the Chinese people and government used the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. The ROC adopted the Gregorian calendar for official business but used the new Era of the Republic as the epoch. After claiming victory over the Chinese mainland in 1949, the PRC opted to use the Gregorian calendar along with its epoch.

#### Accuracy

The Minguo calendar is intrinsically based on and locked to the Gregorian calendar, making it perfectly accurate.
