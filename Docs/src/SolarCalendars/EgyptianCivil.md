#### Overview

The Egyptian Civil calendar was the calendar used by Ancient Egypt, alongside its lunar calendar.

It featured 12 months of 30 days, divided into 3 seasons of 4 months each. The months have names but are usually labeled by their sequence in each season, leading to a pattern of [month] [season] [day]. Each year has 5 intercalary days with individual names at the end, for a total of 365 days.

The new year historically was intended to mark the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, but due to its inaccuracy it drifted by one day every 3 years. The new year eventually lines back up with the heliacal rising of Sirius every 1461 years, called the Sothic Cycle.

The epoch changed with each dynasty, and I could not find evidence of a standardized epoch. Here I have chosen to show the years since the believed beginning of the calendar, which is the day of the heliacal rising of Sirius in 2781 BCE.

#### Accuracy

This calendar is based on the Sothic Cycle, which is well-established to the Gregorian calendar via the Julian calendar. Some liberties were taken with the epoch, which is why it is in parentheses.
