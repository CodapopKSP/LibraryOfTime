#### Overview

The Astronomical calendar is a standard for calculating dates of astronomical or historical events. It is a combination of the Gregorian calendar for dates after midnight on 15 October 1582 and the Julian calendar for dates before.

Unlike the Julian calendar, it utilizes Year 0 to enable the easier calculation of years, which causes it to appear 1 year ahead of the Julian calendar before 1 AD.

Years are not denoted with anything and are simply listed as a positive or negative number.
