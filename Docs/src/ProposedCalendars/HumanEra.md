#### Overview

The Human Era, also known as the Holocene Era, is the calendar representation of time since the beginning of the Holocene and the Neolithic Revolution, when humans started living in fixed agricultural settlements. It was proposed by Cesare Emiliani in 1993 CE and is based on the Gregorian calendar.

#### Info

The Human Era is an attempt to adapt the Gregorian calendar, which has become widespread enough that it could be considered the default calendar of the world, in a way that is free from religious influence. It chooses its epoch based on what may be the most significant moment in human history: the time when humans first created civilization. Conventiently, this occurs roughly 10000 years before 1 AD, allowing for simple math to arrive at the converted date.

#### Accuracy

As this calendar is only a proposal, there really isn't anything to compare it to historically. It is intrinsically based on and locked to the Gregorian calendar, making it perfectly accurate.
