# Proposed Calendars

Proposed calendars are calendar reform systems that have been suggested as alternatives to the Gregorian calendar. These proposals aim to address various issues with the current calendar system, such as irregular month lengths, shifting day-of-week patterns, or religious influences. While none have been officially adopted, they represent interesting approaches to calendar design.
