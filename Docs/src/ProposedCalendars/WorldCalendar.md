#### Overview

The World Calendar was proposed by Elisabeth Achelis in 1930 CE and was nearly adopted by the League of Nations. It features months in a repeating pattern of 31/30/30 days with World's Day happening between December and January and Leapyear Day occurring between June and July in leap years, which happen in the same years as the Gregorian calendar. These two special days are not part of any week nor month, as if the calendar has paused for 24 hours.

The regular month lengths ensure that the first of every month always lands on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday in a predictable pattern that is the same every year.

#### Accuracy

As this calendar is only a proposal, there really isn't anything to compare it to historically. It is intrinsically based on and locked to the Gregorian calendar, making it perfectly accurate.
