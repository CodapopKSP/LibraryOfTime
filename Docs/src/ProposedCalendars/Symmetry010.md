#### Overview

The Symmetry454 calendar is a proposed calendar reform created by Irv Bromberg that is based on the Gregorian calendar.

It features the same months as the Gregorian calendar but of different lengths, following a pattern of 30/31/30 days. This allows for each quarter of every year to follow the same pattern of 13 weeks or 91 days.

The calendar features a leap week that comes after December (humorously labeled as "Irv" by its creator), occurring every 5 or 6 years. This keeps it in line with the Gregorian calendar on a 293-year cycle containing 52 leap years.

The format of the calendar allows each day of the year to always occur on the same day of the week.

#### Info

This calendar is calibrated using 1 January 1 CE as a reference date.
