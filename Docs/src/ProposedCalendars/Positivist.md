#### Overview

The Positivist calendar was created by French philosopher and Positivist Auguste Comte in 1849. It features 13 months of 28 days named after significant figures in Western history.

Each of the 364 days is also named after a historical figure, not all of whom are intended to be remembered as heroes but also as villains. Days of the week are still carried over from the Gregorian calendar, though the final day of the year, The Festival of All the Dead, is not part of a day of the week, as is the following day during leap years, The Festival of Holy Women. Leap year rules follow the Gregorian calendar.

Years are counted from 1789, the year of the French Revolution, and are denoted as "Year of the Great Crisis". Each year starts on January 1 of the Gregorian calendar.

#### Accuracy

As this calendar is only a proposal, there really isn't anything to compare it to historically. It is intrinsically based on and locked to the Gregorian calendar, making it perfectly accurate.
