#### Overview

Coordinated Mars Time, also called MTC as well as Airy Mean Time (AMT), is a proposed clock for use on Mars which has gained some level of mainstream traction in the scientific community. It is intended to be a Martian analog to Earth's UTC.

The time is displayed as hours, minutes, and seconds since midnight on Mars at the location of the Airy-0 crater. The clock is the same as clocks on Earth, with 24 hours and 60 minutes in an hour, though each unit is slightly longer due to the length of the sol being 39 minutes and 35 seconds longer than the day.

#### Info

This clock uses the Mars Sol Date for the calculation determining where midnight begins.

#### Accuracy

This clock should be reasonably accurate, though it might be off by a few minutes or seconds due to Terrestrial Time.
