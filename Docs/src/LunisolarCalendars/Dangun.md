#### Overview

The Dangun calendar is the traditional calendar of Korea. It is no longer officially used, but it is still maintained by the South Korean goverment for cultural purposes and holidays. It is derived from the Chinese lunisolar calendar where it gets its months (월) and days (일) while years (년) are counted from 2333 BCE.

The Dangun calendar is calculated based on midnight in Korea, and as such its dates may misalign, sometimes significantly, from the Chinese lunisolar calendar.

#### Info

The Dangun calendar epoch was not traditionally used, but it has seen unofficial use in the 20th century.

#### Accuracy

This calendar relies on the same calculations as the Chinese Lunisolar Calendar, though using midnight in Korea as the start of the say. Thus, it may vary mildly or significantly from the Chinese calendar. This may or may not itself be accurate, but the result should be relatively close to reality.

#### Source

Some general information was taken from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_calendar) for this calendar, but the general calculation is derived from the Chinese lunisolar calendar.
