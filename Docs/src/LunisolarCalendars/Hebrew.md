#### Overview

The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar used by the Jewish faith for religious and celebratory purposes, and it is also an official calendar of Israel.

It features 12 months of 29 or 30 days that start approximately on the day of the New Moon, referred to as a Molad. It has an intercalary 13th month added after the month of Adar, called Adar II, based on the Metonic cycle which places 7 leap years in every cycle of 19 years. 

Years are denoted with AM for 'Anno Mundi', meaning 'in the year of the world', referring to the Jewish date of Creation around the year 3760 BCE.

#### Info

The Hebrew calendar is not strictly based on the moon. The modern Jewish calendar, which is a mathematical equation, was codified by Rabbi Hillel II in the year 358 CE. Days start at sunset, which is approximated as 18:00 in Israel.
