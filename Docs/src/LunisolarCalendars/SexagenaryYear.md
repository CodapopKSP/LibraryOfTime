#### Overview

The Sexagenary Cycle is a system of counting years in the Chinese calendar (and several other aspects of life). It is a multiplication of the 10 Heavenly Stems and the 12 Earthly Branches (Chinese Zodiac) with half of the combinations left out, leading to a total cycle length of 60. The cycle moves to the next combination on the day of the New Year in the Chinese lunisolar calendar.

#### Accuracy

This calendar system should be very accurate. It may be off by a few days at the start of a given year, or rarely an entire month, due to the inaccuracies from the Chinese lunisolar calendar calculations. However, it corrects itself by the next new moon.

#### Source

Some general information was taken from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle) for this calendar, but the general calculation is derived from the Chinese lunisolar calendar.
