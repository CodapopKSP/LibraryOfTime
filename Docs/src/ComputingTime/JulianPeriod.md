#### Overview

The Julian Period is a simple count of years in the Julian Calendar beginning at noon on 24 November 4713 BCE (1 January 4713 BC in the Julian Calerndar). It is used by historians to date events when no calendar date is given or when previous given dates are deemed to be incorrect.

#### Info

The Julian Period is the count of days since the last time Indiction, Solar and Lunar cycles all started on the same day, and repeats in a cycle of 7980 years.

#### Accuracy

The Julian Period is a simple count of days, meaning it should be exactly accurate. However, sources for this cycle aren't exactly clear if the year updates on the Julian or Astronomical calendar, so I have chosen to use the Julian Calendar. I've also taken some liberties by adding the cycle number, which is not explicitly defined in any source but is heavily implied.

#### Source

All of the information on this calendar came from its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day).
