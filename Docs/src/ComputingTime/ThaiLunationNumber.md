# Thai Lunation Number

| Epoch             | Confidence |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| 22 March 638 CE   | Exact      |

#### Overview

The Lunation Number is the number of New Moons since the epoch. There are several variations of this number.

This lunation number is used by the Buddhist calendar. It uses the New Moon of 22 March 638 CE for its epoch, in this case denoted as Lunation 0.

#### Info

As lunations are important to many calendars and cultures, there are many competing standards.

The Thai Lunation Number can be calculated by adding 16843 to the Lunation Number.

#### Accuracy

The lunation number is a simple calculation of time since the epoch divided by the average lunar cycle length. As the lunar cycle can vary by several hours, the time that the lunation number changes might not exactly match the current lunation. It is mostly intended to be used as an approximate reference rather than as a rigid definition of when the lunation has occurred.
