# Brown Lunation Number

| Epoch              | Confidence |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| 17 January 1923 CE | Exact      |

#### Overview

The Lunation Number is the number of New Moons since the epoch. There are several variations of this number.

This lunation number was created by Ernest William Brown. It uses the New Moon of 17 January 1923 CE for its epoch, in this case denoted as Lunation 1.

#### Info

As lunations are important to many calendars and cultures, there are many competing standards.

The Brown Lunation Number can be calculated by adding 953 to the Lunation Number.

#### Accuracy

The lunation number is a simple calculation of time since the epoch divided by the average lunar cycle length. As the lunar cycle can vary by several hours, the time that the lunation number changes might not exactly match the current lunation. It is mostly intended to be used as an approximate reference rather than as a rigid definition of when the lunation has occurred.
