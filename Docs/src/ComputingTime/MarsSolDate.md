#### Overview

The Mars Sol Date, similar to the Julian Day Number, is the number of sols that have passed since the epoch. A sol is the name for the Martian day, and it is slightly longer than an Earth day. Currently I haven't been able to figure out exactly why the epoch was chosen. The day increments when the Airy-0 crater reaches midnight.

#### Info

One Mars sol is 39 minutes and 35 seconds longer than an Earth day.

#### Accuracy

This clock should be very accurate, though it relies on Î”T which ultimately is only an approximation.

#### Source

All of the information on this clock came from its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars).
