#### Overview

The Julian Circad Number was a system created by Thomas Gangale in tandem with the Darian calendar for the Saturn moon, Titan. It is inspired by the Julian Day Number, but it counts circads from an epoch rather than days.

The epoch was chosen as the conjunction of the sun and Titan (when Titan was directly between the sun and Saturn) that occurred nearest to the epoch generally shared by the other Darian calendars.

#### Info

One circad is about 23 hours, 57 minutes and 13.11 seconds (0.998068439 days).

#### Accuracy

The accuracy of this timekeeping system is wholely dependent on the writings and calculations of Thomas Gangale. It is likely that these calculations weren't precise enough to extend more than a few decades, as they do seem to drift from ephemeris data.

The epoch is noted to account for the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter in the Galilean calendars, but it isn't clear if it has also been accounted for in this clock.

This formula was extrapolated from the writings of Thomas Gangale found at [this website](https://ops-alaska.com/time/gangale_saturn/Darian_Titan_main.htm).

It can be somewhat calibrated using [this model](https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/saturns-moons-javascript-utility/) if you know what you're doing.
