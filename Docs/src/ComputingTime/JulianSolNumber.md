#### Overview

The Julian Sol Number, created by Thomas Gangale, is similar to the Julian Day Number but it counts the number of sols that have passed since the epoch. A sol is the name for the Martian day, and it is slightly longer than an Earth day. This epoch marks an important Martian Vernal Equinox. The day increments when the Airy-0 crater reaches midnight.

In a chat I had with with Mr. Gangale, he expressed his desire for this standard to be deprecated, as the Mars Sol Date created by Michael Allison had received wider use. However, since it was used at one point, I have opted to include it in this website.

"The sooner that things become standardized, the better, so consider the JS to be obsolete." -Thomas Gangale, 2024

#### Info

One Mars sol is 39 minutes and 35 seconds longer than an Earth day.

#### Accuracy

This clock should be very accurate, though there are some very minor inaccuracies likely stemming from the redefiniton of the epoch of the Mars Sol Day, or perhaps slight differences in calculations of Î”T.

#### Source

Much of the information on this clock came from its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars).

Dates can also be verified with [this website](https://ops-alaska.com/time/gangale_converter/calendar_clock.htm), though some inaccuracies have been noted.
