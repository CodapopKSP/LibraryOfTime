# LORAN-C

| Epoch             | Confidence |

#### Overview

Long Range Navigational time was the standard used by the US and other jurisdictions prior to the creation of GPS. It deviates from UTC by the number of leap seconds since 1972 and doesn't include the 10 extra leap seconds in TAI.

#### Info

LORAN-C uses a network of radio transmitters to determine distance using the synchronized time, similar to GPS that uses satellites.

#### Accuracy

It is difficult to find a current representation of LORAN-C despite it apparently still being in use. I have reconstructed this clock based off of the provided source as well as explanations of the specifics.

#### Source

Much of the information for this clock came from [this website](http://www.leapsecond.com/java/gpsclock.htm).
