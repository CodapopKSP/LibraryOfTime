#### Overview

ISO 8601 is the standard of displaying date and time provided by the International Organization for Standardization. It is based off the Gregorian calendar and utilizes year 0.

#### Info

ISO 8601 is intended to provide a clear, unambiguous date time format for international use.

#### Accuracy

ISO 8601 is derived directly from Unix time and thus is exactly accurate.

#### Source

ISO 8601 is actually a supported string of JavaScript's native Date library, so there is nothing for this website to calculate. General information came from its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
