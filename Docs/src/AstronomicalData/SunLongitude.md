# Longitude of the Sun

| Epoch             | Confidence |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Northward Equinox | High       |

#### Overview

This is the approximate longitude of the sun, the distance in degrees the Earth has traveled along its orbit since the last Northward Equinox.

#### Info

The longitude of the sun is an important factor in the Chinese lunisolar calendar and its derivatives. As a circle has 360 degrees and the year has roughly 365 days, the longitude of the sun increments a little less than 1 degree each day.

#### Accuracy

The accuracy of this calculation depends on the precision of Meeus's calculations. My solutions for the example problems matched those from the book, so I am reasonably sure it is correct and only deviates slightly from reality.

#### Source

This calculation was sourced from [Astronomical Algorithms (1991)](https://archive.org/details/astronomicalalgorithmsjeanmeeus1991/page/n7/mode/2up) by Jean Meeus.
