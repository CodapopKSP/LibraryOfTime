#### Overview

Revolutionary Time is the timekeeping system employed by France during the French Revolution from 1794 to 1800. It divides the day into 10 hours, each hour into 100 minutes, and each minute into 100 seconds.

The French would have used Paris Mean Time (GMT + 00:09:21) but this website uses local time.
