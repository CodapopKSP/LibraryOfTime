# Dream Time

| Epoch             | Confidence |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Midnight          | Exact       |

#### Overview

According to the movie Inception, time in a dream is experienced 20 times slower, allowing for several days to be experienced in a single night's sleep. The time displayed here is the current time in your dream if you had begun sleeping at midnight.

#### Info

The concept of time dilation in dreams is actually a fascinating area of study, with some results showing little or no dilation while others show differences in reaction times in dreams. Whatever the real dilation ratio may be, it is nowhere near that expressed in the film.

#### Accuracy

This timekeeping system should be perfectly accurate but the epoch will not be the same for everyone, as people don't all sleep at the same time.

#### Source

This calculation was sourced from the movie [Inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_(film)).
