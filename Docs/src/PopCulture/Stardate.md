# Stardate

| Epoch             | Confidence |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| 25 April 2265     | Low       |

#### Overview

Stardate is the timekeeping system found in Star Trek. Being a fictional system without an exact algorithm, it isn't even clear what Stardates are measuring. They also vary from series to series.

This calculation is based on the Stardate 0 epoch of 25 April 2265 from the Original Series, with a peculiar 7.21 stardates per day.

#### Info

Stardates were originally intended to be a system similar to the revised Julian Day Number, but the writers of the show weren't required to follow an exact algorithm.

#### Accuracy

Since this calendar is both fictional and without an exact algorithm, it is impossible to know how accurate this calculation is.

#### Source

This calculation was sourced from [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek).
