# Termina Time

| Epoch             | Confidence |

#### Overview

Termina Time is the timekeeping system found in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.

It features a cycle of 3 days of 24 hours that are each 150 seconds long when slowed. Days start at sunrise at 6:00am, so 5:00 of one day is followed by 6:00 of the next day.

#### Info

Slowed time was chosen over regular time due to the former fitting cleanly within three real life hours. The entire 3-day cycle in regular time takes 54 minutes, which would create an awkward short cycle at each real life day change (or rather, 6:00am).

#### Accuracy

This timekeeping system should be perfectly accurate based on local time.
