Unfortunately, there seems to be a bit of induced error on top of that, as my solutions don't exactly match those provided by Meeus. This could be due to JavaScript's base-2 calculations or due to a misunderstanding in some of the steps. However, they are very close, within a few seconds for any given output.</p>
<p>The epoch for this value is not an epoch but rather a moment where ΔT is close to zero.</p>

<p>The Julian Circad Number was a system created by Thomas Gangale in tandem with the Darian calendar for the Saturn moon, Titan. It is inspired by the Julian Day Number, but it counts circads from an epoch rather than days.</p>
<p>The epoch was chosen as the conjunction of the sun and Titan (when Titan was directly between the sun and Saturn) that occurred nearest to the epoch generally shared by the other Darian calendars.</p>
<h4 id="info-26"><a class="header" href="#info-26">Info</a></h4>

<p>The French Republican calendar was used during and after the French Revolution from 1793 to 1805 and was a drastic change to the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>It featured twelve months of 30 days each, broken into 3 weeks of 10 days. The remaining 5 or 6 days of each solar year were the Sansculottides, to be treated as national holidays at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The new year started on the Autumn Equinox, and years were written in Roman numerals with the era name of 'l'ère républicaine', or 'Republican Era', abbreviated here as 'RE'.</p>

<p>This calendar depends on the accuracy of the equinox calculations, which are generally within a few minutes of accuracy and should only affect years where the equinox happens very close to midnight CET.</p>
<p>The French Republican calendar also had some issues with rules that contracticted each other, like a 4 year leap year rule conflicting with the date of the equinox. That rule has been ignored in favor of the equinox rule.</p>

<p>It features 19 months (or sometimes referred to as weeks) of 19 days, for a total of 361 days. The remaining 4 or 5 days of each year are called Ayyám-i-Há and take place between the final two months, Mulk and 'Alá', typically at the end of February.</p>
<p>Days start at sunset in Tehran, which is approximated here as 18:00 IRST. Years are denoted with 'BE', meaning Baháʼí Era.</p>
<h4 id="info-49"><a class="header" href="#info-49">Info</a></h4>
<p>The new year starts on the day that the equinox occurs before noon in Iran, or the next day if it occurs after noon. The starting of the new year results in the final month having 29 or 30 days depending on when exactly the equinox occurs.</p>

<p>The accuracy of this calendar depends on the equinox calculations and may be off by a day for a whole year especially if it happens very close to sunset, but it is likely to self-correct by the next year. The equation breaks down considerably if rolled back or forward several thousand years as the equinox drifts due to precession and Terrestrial Time invokes inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Dates may change slightly too early or late depending on the real time of sunset.</p>
<p>There seems to be an issue with the stated epoch on Wikipedia being 1 day later than the calculated epoch here.</p>

<p>The Solar Hijri calendar is a solar calendar used in Islam. It is the official calendar of Iran and Afghanistan. Each year begins on the Spring Equinox or the day after; thus it has no intrinsic error and it very slowly drifts through the Gregorian year following the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>It features 12 months, corresponding to the zodiacal signs, with the first 6 having 31 days and the latter 6 having 30 (or 29) days to account for the sun traveling slower through the Zodiac due to Earth's oblong orbit. In Afghanistan the month names still refer to the Zodiac while elsewhere this calendar uses the Zoroastrian month names.</p>
<p>Unlike the lunar Hijri calendar, days start at midnight, though they both share the same epoch of number of years from the Hijrah. In this calendar, years are denoted with 'SH', 'HS', 'AH', or 'AHSh', typically referencing the name of the calendar.</p>
<h4 id="info-52"><a class="header" href="#info-52">Info</a></h4>
<p>The new year starts on the day that the equinox occurs before noon in Iran, or the next day if it occurs after noon. The starting of the new year results in the final month having 29 or 30 days depending on when exactly the equinox occurs.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Civil calendar was the calendar used by Ancient Egypt, alongside its lunar calendar.</p>
<p>It featured 12 months of 30 days, divided into 3 seasons of 4 months each.

Each year has 5 intercalary days with individual names at the end, for a total of 365 days.</p>
<p>The new year historically was intended to mark the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, but due to its inaccuracy it drifted by one day every 3 years. The new year eventually lines back up with the heliacal rising of Sirius every 1461 years, called the Sothic Cycle.</p>

<p>The Maya Long Count calendar is essentially a simple count of the number of days since the Maya date of creation. It is a five digit number, typically expressed with periods between the digits, made up of base-20 counters with the exception of the middle-right digit which is base-18.</p>
<p>Starting with the right, the smallest unit is the <strong>kʼin</strong>, which is equivalent to a day. Twenty kʼins make up one <strong>winal</strong>, 18 winals make up one <strong>tun</strong>, 20 tuns make up one <strong>kʼatun</strong>, and finally 20 kʼatuns make up one <strong>bʼakʼtun</strong>. A bʼakʼtun is roughly 394 solar years.</p>
<p>The Maya Long Count Calendar was of international interest in 2012 as it was the time when the bʼakʼtun incremented from 12 to 13, leading to superstitious theories and hysteria.</p>
<h4 id="info-59"><a class="header" href="#info-59">Info</a></h4>
<p>Notably, winals are counted in base-18 rather than base-20 like the rest of the units. This is to reasonably match the tun to the length of the solar year. However, it is still over 5 days short, meaning it will drift about half as much as a true lunar calendar. 20 winals would be 400 days, which wouldn't have been as useful.</p>

<p>Correlating the Maya Long Count calendar was a matter of debate even in recent times. The majority of scholars seem to have accepted the Goodman–Martinez–Thompson (GMT) correlation.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this calendar is actually very easy to calculate, as it is just a count of days since the epoch, not unlike the Julian Day Number. It has no concept of intercalary time such as leap days and the count is agnostic of the solar or lunar years. The only method of inaccuracy with this calendar could be when exactly each day increments, but that does not affect the rest of the calendar in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>The Tzolkin is one of the calendars used by the Maya. It is a 260-day calendar with an unknown significance; suggestions include simple multiplications of important numbers as well as the length of a typical human gestation period.</p>
<p>The Tzolkin is a unique calendar, with day numbers increasing sequentially from 1-13 while the 20 day names also increment, leading to a system where 1 of a given day name is followed by 2 of the next day name, completing a cycle in 260 days.</p>
<p>The Tzolkin combines with another Maya calendar, the 365-day Haab, to create the Maya Calendar Round. This is the cycle that the two calendars create, which takes roughly 52 years to complete.</p>
<p>Cycles do not increment outside the Calendar Round, so it is impossible to say for certain what the epoch for the Tzolkin should be, but sometime around 1100 BCE is accepted among historians.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Night is a day cycle used by the Maya people. It is a simple cycle of 9 incrementing days that reflect the Maya deity that rules that night.</p>
<p>The names of 8 of the lords have not been identified, but the G9 lord is named Pauahtun.</p>
<p>The Maya also had another day cycle of 7 days of unknown utility, referred to simply as 'Y'.</p>

<p>The Darian calendar is a proposed calendar for use on Mars. It was created in 1985 by Thomas Gangale and named after his son, Darius.</p>
<p>It takes the ~668.5 sol Martian year (~687 Earth days) and divides it into 24 months of 28 or 27 sols. The new year is on the day of the Martian Northern Equinox.</p>
<p>The epoch is the Vernal Equinox of Julian Sol Number 0, taking place on 12 March 1609 CE at 18:40:06 UTC.</p>
<p>Leap years add one extra day in the final month, and they take place if the year number is odd or divisible by 10, unless also divisible by 100 except if divisible by 1000, though this formula changes after Darian year 2000 and gets updated every few thousand years as the orbit of Mars becomes more eccentric.</p>

<p>This calendar depends on the Julian Sol Number which is in turn based on the Mars Sol Date. Assuming these are all accurate, then the Darian calendar should be correct.</p>
<p>There is one more stipulation that the current calendar is only perfectly accurate between the years 0 and 2000 due to the shortening of the Martian equinox year. Whether those are Martian years or Earth years isn't clear, but the difference is rather small and is currently ignored for this calendar.</p>

<p>The Galilean calendars were created by Thomas Gangale for use on the four Galilean moons of Jupiter---Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are intended to loosely align with the Earth-based Gregorian calendar, roughly sharing an epoch and most month names.</p>
<p>The inner three moons are in a 2:4:8 Laplace resonance, and thus their orbits and solar days are in nearly exact ratios. As the solar day of Io, the inner-most moon, is over 42 hours, its day is broken into two units of time called 'circads' that are ~21 hours each and act as calendar days. The remaining moons have their orbits broken up into similar-sized circads: 4 for Europa, 8 for Ganymede, and 19 for Callisto.</p>
<p>The calendars all share circads, months, and weeks of 8 circads, though they drift in and out of phase with each other depending on intercalation. There are 13 months, with the 'extra' month of Mercedonius added between the February and March analogs. Generally months have 32 circads, but Ganymede's Junius is only 24 circads, as well as the month of December for all moons in non-leap years. The months are also prefixed with a shorthand name of the moon.</p>
<h4 id="info-63"><a class="header" href="#info-63">Info</a></h4>
<p>All four of the Galilean calendars use roughly the same epoch, within a week, as the Gregorian calendar, each of which corresponds with their Meridian Time.</p>
<p>The Galilean months are roughly equal to the Gregorian months, though with slightly different names as well as a 13th month added between Februarius and Martius. Each moon has a slightly different day arrangement.</p>

As the solar day of Io, the inner-most moon, is over 42 hours, its day is broken into two units of time called 'circads' that are ~21 hours each and act as calendar days. The remaining moons have their orbits broken up into similar-sized circads: 4 for Europa, 8 for Ganymede, and 19 for Callisto.</p>
<p>The calendars all share circads, months, and weeks of 8 circads, though they drift in and out of phase with each other depending on intercalation. Generally months have 32 circads, with few exceptions, most notably the final month that can be intercalated to have 24, 32, or 40 circads. The months are also prefixed with a shorthand name of the moon.</p>

<p>As the solar day of Titan is nearly 16 Earth days long, its day is broken into 16 units of time called 'circads' that are ~24 hours each and act as calendar days.</p>
<p>This calendar features 24 months of 28 or 32 circads each, allowing for a clean division of the 8-circad week.</p>
<p>Leap years add an entire week, split evenly between the 12th and 24th months, adding 4 circads each for a total of 32 circads, allowing it to stay in sync with the Martian Darian calendar.</p>
<p>Years don't always begin and end at midnight on Titan's prime meridian, as the circad system takes precedence over the solar day.</p>

<p>The Sothic Cycle is the relationship between the start of the new year of the Egyptian calendar and the heliacal rising of the star of Sirius, which was originally what the calendar was based on.</p>
<p>The Egyptian calendar had years of exactly 365 days while the heliacal rising of Siruis is on a cycle of 365.25 days, causing the two to drift apart and eventually come together again over the course of 1460 years. This rate of error was one of the references for the creation of the Julian calendar, meaning the two calendars share the same relationship through the cycle. For every 1460 Julian years there are 1461 Egyptian years.</p>
<p>The first cycle is believed to begin on 27 June 2781 BCE, which is implied to be the date of the creation of the Egyptian calendar.</p>

<p>The Pawukon calendar of Bali, Indonesia is a 210-day cycle of ten repeating and undulating "weeks" that happen concurrently. The first week has only 1 day, the second week has 2 days, the third week has 3 days, and so on.</p>
<p>Weeks 3, 5, 6, and 7 all simply cycle through their days. Weeks 4 and 8 also cycle but repeat the 71st day for days 72 and 73, a form of intercalation, in order to match the 210-day cycle. Week 9 also intercalates by repeating the 1st day for days 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>Weeks 1, 2, and 10 operate on more complex rules, involving adding the 'urip', a special number assigned to each day, of the days of Week 5 and Week 7 and adding 1. If the resulting number is even, then Week 1 and 2 are the first and second days respectively. If it's odd, then Week 2 is the first day and Week 1 is missing entirely. If this number matches the urip of any day in Week 10, then it is that day in Week 10.</p>
<p>Each of the 30 cycles of Week 7 also has a name. This calendar does not count the number of cycles and has no epoch.</p>

<p>This is the approximate date and time of this year's Northward Equinox. In the Northern Hemisphere this is known as the Spring Equinox. In the Southern Hemisphere it is known as the Fall Equinox. It is the time when the length of the day and night are equal all over the planet and the solar declination is heading northward.</p>
<h4 id="info-76"><a class="header" href="#info-76">Info</a></h4>
<p>The Northward Equinox is an important starting point or anchor point in some calendars. It usually occurs around March 20th. Over time, roughly in a cycle of 25,772 years, Earth's axes precess, causing the equinoxes and solstices to slowly drift through the entire year.</p>

<p>New Moons are on average 29.53059 days apart, but that number can vary by several hours in a given cycle due to the shape of the moon's orbit as well as other gravitational effects. Thus, it is often necessary to calculate each New Moon directly.</p>

<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the moon casts a shadow anywhere onto the Earth. It is a fairly rare event that always occurs during a New Moon.</p>
<p>When the moon completely covers the disk of the sun from the perpective of a point on the Earth, it is called a Total Solar Eclipse. When the moon appears to be smaller than the sun, with the sun visible in a 'Ring of Fire' around the edge, it is called an Annular Solar Eclipse. When the moon covers part of the sun but doesn't intersect the center of the sun's disk, it is called a Partial Solar Eclipse.</p>
<p>This entry also displays the node at which the eclipse took place as well as the hemisphere of Earth where it is visible at its maximum.</p>
<p>Solar eclipses typically are only viewable from a small area on the Earth's surface, and they are historically significant events that have inspired legend, religion, and myth. The solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 CE is what inspired me to build this website.</p>
<h4 id="info-85"><a class="header" href="#info-85">Info</a></h4>
<p>Solar eclipses happen two to four times per year, though total solar eclipses are rarer (every two or three years). They can only occur when a New Moon happens very near to the moon's ascending or descending nodes—the points along the lunar orbit that intersect the Earth's equator. These are at 0°/360° and 180° respectively.</p>
<p>Due to the oblong shape of the moon's orbit, the moon can either appear larger or smaller than the sun from the perspective of Earth. This coincidence produces the two different types of central eclipses, total and annular.</p>
<p>During a total solar eclipse, the sun's corona is visible to the naked eye, providing a spectacular sight as well as an opportunity to conduct science.</p>
<h4 id="accuracy-85"><a class="header" href="#accuracy-85">Accuracy</a></h4>
<p>This calculation is reasonably accurate within thousands of years of 2000 CE. After that, errors are induced which can grow from hours to even days.</p>

<p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth casts a shadow anywhere onto the moon. It is a fairly rare event that always occurs during a Full Moon.</p>
<p>When the moon is completely covered by Earth's shadow (also known as the Umbra), it is called a Total Lunar Eclipse. When the moon only partially intersects the Umbra, it is called a Partial Lunar Eclipse. When the Earth only covers a part of the sun's disk from the perspective of the moon, it is called a Penumbral Lunar Eclipse.</p>

<p>Lunar eclipses happen two to four times per year. Penumbral eclipses typically aren't noticeable from Earth, as the lunar surface is still quite bright. The moon must enter deep within the Penumbra or into the Umbra before it is able to be noticed with the naked eye.

<p>The Chinese lunisolar calendar is one of the most successful and widespread calendars in history. It has been used since ancient times and is still used today by much of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features numerically-named months (月 "yue") of 29 or 30 days (日 "ri") that begin on the same day as the New Moon in China (CST), with an intercalary month added on leap years that happen roughly every 2 or 3 solar years (年 "nian"). Years are also named in a 12-year cycle of the 12 Earthly Branches (Chinese Zodiac).</p>
<p>Different versions of this calendar use different eras, but this website uses 2697 BCE as the Year of the Yellow Emperor (2698 BC), a date which was standardized by Sun Yat-sen in 1912 despite there being controversy over the exact date.</p>

<p>The Dangun calendar is the traditional calendar of Korea. It is no longer officially used, but it is still maintained by the South Korean goverment for cultural purposes and holidays. It is derived from the Chinese lunisolar calendar where it gets its months (월) and days (일) while years (년) are counted from 2333 BCE.</p>
<p>The Dangun calendar is calculated based on midnight in Korea, and as such its dates may misalign, sometimes significantly, from the Chinese lunisolar calendar.</p>

<p>The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar used by the Jewish faith for religious and celebratory purposes, and it is also an official calendar of Israel.</p>
<p>It features 12 months of 29 or 30 days that start approximately on the day of the New Moon, referred to as a Molad. It has an intercalary 13th month added after the month of Adar, called Adar II, based on the Metonic cycle which places 7 leap years in every cycle of 19 years.</p>
<p>Years are denoted with AM for 'Anno Mundi', meaning 'in the year of the world', referring to the Jewish date of Creation around the year 3760 BCE.</p>
<h4 id="info-91"><a class="header" href="#info-91">Info</a></h4>
<p>The Hebrew calendar is not strictly based on the moon. The modern Jewish calendar, which is a mathematical equation, was codified by Rabbi Hillel II in the year 358 CE. Days start at sunset, which is approximated as 18:00 in Israel.</p>

<p>The Umm al-Qura calendar is the Islamic calendar used in Saudi Arabia. The Hijri calendar, of which the Umm al-Qura is a variation of, is perhaps the only extant true lunar calendar in the world. It features 12 lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with days starting at sunset, for a total of 355 or 356 days per year, causing it to be out of sync with solar calendars.</p>
<p>Era dates are denoted 'AH' from 'Anno Hegirae', meaning 'In the year of the Hijrah'. Each month starts shortly after the New Moon when it begins to appear as a crescent.</p>
<p>The desert-faring culture of Islam is apparent in this calendar, as such a civilization is less affected by seasonal changes than civilizations in most other biomes. Thus, they would have had no need to implement an intercalary month system to synchronize the calendar with the solar year.</p>
<h4 id="info-92"><a class="header" href="#info-92">Info</a></h4>
<p>The Hijri calendar is on a roughly 37-year cycle when compared with the solar year. Dates and holidays drift throughout the entire year before arriving back where they started 37 years prior.</p>

<p>The Togys calendar was used by Kazakh nomads. It consists of 13 or 14 months of 27 or 28 days. Months begin on the day when the moon crosses through the Pleiades star cluster (or matches its right ascension) and follows the sidereal month, making it particularly unique among calendars.</p>
<p>Each month is named after the approximate age of the moon on the first day; since the sidereal month is around 2 days shorter than the lunar month, each time the moon passes through Pleiades, it looks visually distinct.</p>
<p>The year begins on the month with the youngest moon, in April or May just before Pleiades moves behind the sun. With the solar year as its base unit, this makes the Togys calendar a Solilunar calendar.</p>
<p>Years follow a 12-year animal cycle similar to the Chinese lunisolar calendar and its derivatives. There is no official epoch, but some sources use 3669 BCE as the start of Kazakh nomad chronology.</p>
<h4 id="info-93"><a class="header" href="#info-93">Info</a></h4>
<p>Kazakh nomads seem to have used the actual visual appearance of the moon at the point of eclipsing Pleiades as the month name. This makes the Togys calendar one of the few calendars that doesn't need complex rules or an authoritative body, being dictated by a very simple concept that is easy for any individual to check.</p>

<p>The Human Era is an attempt to adapt the Gregorian calendar, which has become widespread enough that it could be considered the default calendar of the world, in a way that is free from religious influence. It chooses its epoch based on what may be the most significant moment in human history: the time when humans first created civilization. Conventiently, this occurs roughly 10000 years before 1 AD, allowing for simple math to arrive at the converted date.</p>

Days typically start when the player wakes up from their bed, and although there is a clock in the game, it has little information to expand upon that.

<p>Stardate is the timekeeping system found in Star Trek. Being a fictional system without an exact algorithm, it isn't even clear what Stardates are measuring. They also vary from series to series.</p>
<p>This calculation is based on the Stardate 0 epoch of 25 April 2265 from the Original Series, with a peculiar 7.21 stardates per day.</p>
<h4 id="info-112"><a class="header" href="#info-112">Info</a></h4>
<p>Stardates were originally intended to be a system similar to the revised Julian Day Number, but the writers of the show weren't required to follow an exact algorithm.</p>

<p>The Tamrielic calendar is used in the Elder Scrolls franchise. It is a simple 1-1 mapping to the Gregorian calendar, including its leap years.</p>
<p>It has 12 months of 28-31 days along with weeks of seven days. Since the timeline is fictional, it is impossible to map it to a specific epoch. This site assumes the Tamrielic calendar shares a New Year with the Gregorian.</p>

<p>US terms don't always start on January 20th, with certain stipulations such as if the 20th falls on a Sunday that could change the date slightly. The current system of terms starting on the 20th didn't start until 1937, and previously it was March 4th, with George Washington starting on April 30th.</p>
