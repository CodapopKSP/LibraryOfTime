        overview: 'The Maya Long Count calendar is essentially a simple count of the number of days since the Maya date of creation. It is a five digit number, typically expressed with periods between the digits, made up of base-20 counters with the exception of the middle-right digit which is base-18.\n\nStarting with the right, the smallest unit is the <b>kÊ¼in</b>, which is equivalent to a day. Twenty kÊ¼ins make up one <b>winal</b>, 18 winals make up one <b>tun</b>, 20 tuns make up one <b>kÊ¼atun</b>, and finally 20 kÊ¼atuns make up one <b>bÊ¼akÊ¼tun</b>. A bÊ¼akÊ¼tun is roughly 394 solar years.\n\nThe Maya Long Count Calendar was of international interest in 2012 as it was the time when the bÊ¼akÊ¼tun incremented from 12 to 13, leading to superstitious theories and hysteria.',

        info: 'Calculating the New Moon is no easy task. It involves several steps and different tables of equations, and it is likely the most resource-taxing calculation on this site. Unfortunately it also must be calculated several times due to the nature of lunar calendars, though the date shown here is resused when possible. New Moons are on average 29.53059 days apart, but that number can vary by several hours in a given cycle due to the shape of the moon\'s orbit as well as other gravitational effects. Thus, it is often necessary to calculate each New Moon directly.',

        overview: `A solar eclipse occurs when the moon casts a shadow anywhere onto the Earth. It is a fairly rare event that always occurs during a New Moon.\n\nWhen the moon completely covers the disk of the sun from the perpective of a point on the Earth, it is called a Total Solar Eclipse. When the moon appears to be smaller than the sun, with the sun visible in a 'Ring of Fire' around the edge, it is called an Annular Solar Eclipse. When the moon covers part of the sun but doesn't intersect the center of the sun's disk, it is called a Partial Solar Eclipse.\n\nThis entry also displays the node at which the eclipse took place as well as the hemisphere of Earth where it is visible at its maximum.\n\nSolar eclipses typically are only viewable from a small area on the Eath's surface, and they are historically significant events that have inspired legend, religion, and myth. The solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 CE is what inspired me to build this website.`,
        info: `Solar eclipses typically happen every one or two years, though total solar eclipses are rarer. They can only occur when a New Moon happens very near to the moon's ascending or descending nodesâthe points along the lunar orbit that intersect the Earth's equator. These are at 0Â°/360Â° and 180Â° respectively.\n\nDue to the oblong shape of the moon's orbit, the moon can either appear larger or smaller than the sun from the perspective of Earth. This coincidence produces the two different types of central eclipses, total and annular.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the sun's corona is visible to the naked eye, providing a spectacular sight as well as an opportunity to conduct science.`,
        accuracy: 'This calculation is reasonably accurate within thousands of years of 2000 CE. After that, errors are induced which can grow from hours to even days.\n\nThis calculation relies on the New Moon calculation as well as Terrestrial Time, each of which have potential to induce errors, either due to my own misunderstanding of the source or because of the uncertainty of the cosmos.',
